### What software do I need?

All you need is to [install GPT4all](../index.md) onto you Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.

### Is there an API?

Yes, you can run your model in server-mode with our [OpenAI-compatible API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions), which you can configure in [settings](../gpt4all_desktop/settings.md#application-settings)

## Hardware

### What hardware do I need?

GPT4All can run on CPU, Metal (Apple Silicon M1+), and GPU.

Your CPU needs to support [AVX or AVX2 instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) and you need enough RAM to load a model into memory.
