echo -e "\n🔍 Missing Functionality Analysis:"
echo "=================================="

echo "❌ CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES:"
echo "   • Real AI model integration (currently mock responses)"
echo "   • Actual GPT4All ChatLLM connection"
echo "   • Model loading and management"
echo "   • Conversation history persistence"

echo -e "\n❌ IMPORTANT MISSING FEATURES:"
echo "   • Authentication/API key support"
echo "   • Rate limiting"
echo "   • Request size limits"
echo "   • Advanced error handling"
echo "   • Logging and metrics"

echo -e "\n❌ NICE-TO-HAVE MISSING FEATURES:"
echo "   • Function calling support"
echo "   • Tool use capabilities"
echo "   • Model parameter configuration"
echo "   • Context window management"
echo "   • Stop sequences handling"

echo -e "\n🎯 CONCLUSION:"
echo "Current implementation provides a solid HTTP server foundation"
echo "with OpenAI-compatible endpoints, but lacks actual AI capabilities."
echo "It's perfect for testing and development, but needs model integration"
echo "for production AI functionality."
